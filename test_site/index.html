  		<p>This is a picture taken from when I went to do <a href="http://soundoffexperience.com/">Sound Off Experience Yoga</a> at the W Hotel in NYC. We had a fabulous time, the instructor was great and Castel knows how to throw an event like this. Only wish I looked a bit more put together, I was sweaty and stinky since I had just completed a yoga class! The order of how we did everything is below!</p>	
  		<ul>
  			<li>Yoga Class</li>
  			<li>Mingling Afterwards</li>
  			<li>Take a picture</li>
  			<li>Head back to Philadelphia</li>
